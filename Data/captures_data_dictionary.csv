""ND"" indicates this information was not recorded. We cannot verify that species were identified correctly (e.g., Leach's Storm-Petrel versus Ashy Storm-Petrel)."
band_no,character,"Unique individual band number issued by the US Geological Survey Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL) or Mexico's SEMARNAT (Secretaria de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales). ""not banded"" indicates the individual was not banded (reasons for not banding sometimes described in notes)."
recapture,character,"Whether or not the bird was a recapture of a previously banded bird. Codes used : Y (yes, individual had a band when captured), N (no, individual was a new capture and did not have a band when captured), SNR (same night recapture, individual capture rate was >1 during the same mistnetting session). ""ND"" (information was not recorded). "
diet,character,"Whether or not diet sample was collected. Codes used : Y (yes, a diet sample was collected), N (no, a diet sample was not collected). Assumed ""N"" if cell was blank.  "
BP,numeric/character,"Brood patch status of individual. Codes used : 0 (completely covered with down, no incubation patch), 1 (5-50% defeathered, partially downy), 1.5 (51-95% defeathered, partially downy; also recorded as: 1 to 2, 1.5 to 2, 1+), 2 (96-100% bare, unvascularized; also recorded as: 2.5, 2+), 3 (96-100% bare, vascularized, reddish, thickened; also recorded as: 3.5, 3-4), 4 (5-50% refeathered, note pins present), 4.5 (51-95% refeathered, note pins present), 5 (96-100% refeathered, no incubation patch, can be hard to separate from score = 0), B (bare, brood patch evidence), D (down, no incubation patch evident), PD (partly downy, patch forming or receding), ""ND"" (information was not recorded)."
uncorr_mass,numeric,"Uncorrected mass of individual (in g), e.g. includes weight of individual and weighing vessel. Rounded to nearest whole number if value to the tenths or hundredths was provided in raw data. Unconfirmed, but likely all/most measurements were taken with a Pesola spring scale. ""ND"" indicates this information was not recorded. "
mass_tare,numeric,"Mass of the weighing vessel (in g). Rounded to nearest whole number if value to the tenths or hundredths was provided in raw data. Unconfirmed, but likely all/most measurements were taken with a Pesola spring scale. The spring scale was often tared in advance of taking the measurement, resulting in a mass_tare of ""0"". ""ND"" indicates this information was not recorded. "
mass_corr,numeric,"Corrected mass of individual (in g) calculated by substracting mass_tare from uncorr_mass. ""ND"" indicates this information was not recorded. "
culmen,numeric,"Distance between the tip of the forehead fathering at the base of the bill along the ridge of the culemn and the tip of the bill (in mm). Values provided to the hundredths place. Assumed measurements follwed Pyle 2008, also known as exposed culmen. ""ND"" indicates this information was not recorded. "
skull_length,numeric,"Distance between the back of the head and bill tip (in mm). Values provided to the hundredths place. Assumed measurements follwed Pyle 2008, also known as head-bill length. ""ND"" indicates this information was not recorded. "
tarsus,numeric,"Distance from the notch at the end of the lateral condyle of the tibiotarsus, on the back side of the leg, to the last tarsal scute on the front of the leg, at the base of the foot (in mm). Values provided to the hundredths place. Assumed measurements followed traditional tarsus measurement described by Pyle 2008, also known as the ""outside tarsus"" or ""diagonal tarsus."" ""ND"" indicates this information was not recorded. "
wing,numeric,"Distance between the carpal joint and wing tip (end of longest primary) (in mm). Values provided to the tenths place. QAQC on wing chord data revealed that wing chord measurements are smaller in the 1990s and a different method may have been used (e.g., relaxed wing chord versus flattened, see Pyle 2008). ""ND"" indicates this information was not recorded. "
tail,numeric,"Distance between the tip of the longest rectrix and the point of insertion of the two central rectrices (in mm). ""ND"" indicates this information was not recorded. "
sex,numeric,"Sex of bird, if taken. Codes used: M (male), F (female), N (not taken), Y (sample to sex bird was taken). ""ND"" indicates this information was not recorded. From Adams (2016) - sex was determined by blood sample. One drop of blood was collected by aseptic venipuncture from the medial tarsal vein using a 26-gauge needle and a Whatman FTAnucleic acid collection card (GE Healthcare, Brentford, UK). Sex was determined using molecular techniques (Dr. C. Baduini & A. Patel, Keck Science Center, Claremont College, California, following Fridolfsson & Ellegren 1999 and Dawson et al. 2001)."
measurers,character,"Initials of person(s) who handled/banded individual and/or persons present for mistnetting session. See ""participants"" table. ""ND"" indicates this information was not recorded. Not all participant initials could be determined."
flagged,character,"Indicates if record is flagged for review. ""Y"" indicates session is flagged, ""N"" indicates session is not flagged. See ""notes"" field for more information."
notes,character,Miscellaneous information not captured in other fields.
